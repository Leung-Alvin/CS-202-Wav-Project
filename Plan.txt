Make the executable: ./wavio
When we run it, we should ask the user if they want to quit as a parameter "quit" (Function)
"Type "Quit" to quit out of Wavio or type in a wav file name to continue" (Readline cin)
If they type "Quit", we can just return 0.
Else if they type nonexistent file, we ask them to type a valid file, throw error and ask again quit or start (Make into function)
Else if they type noncompatible file, throw error and ask again quit or start
Else, we open the file.
